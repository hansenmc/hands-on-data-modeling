NOTE: The Application Server defaults to port 8080.  Update rest.json as required.

Make sure that cURL is in your path. 

### Linux/Mac:

Usage: 

    cd setup
    ./setup.sh

NOTE: Update each .sh file with your own username/password credentials as required.

### Windows:

Usage: 

    cd setup
    setup.bat

NOTE: Update each .bat file with your own username/password credentials as required.

NOTE: cURL is not installed on Windows by default.

#### cURL on Windows

If you choose to use cURL on Windows. Download and unzip [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) on your filesystem. To be able to use it from a cmd window, you will need to add it to the 'Path' system variable.

- Right click, computer, properties.
- Select advanced system setttings.
- Select environment variables.
- Under system variables, Select and doubleclick Path.
- Add ';C:\Curl' (use the directory where you have unzipped cURL) without quotes to the end of the Path variable value.
- Click OK
- If you have a cmd window open, close it and restart it to have the changes applied.

Note: If you don't want to use cURL. You can use Query Console for Setup.  See below.

## Query Console Exercises
